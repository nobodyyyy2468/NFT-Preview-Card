## My process

1. Prepare the Main Card display as a flexbox inside the Browser webpage view
2. Place this in the center along the horizontal axis (justify-content) & vertical axis (align-items)
3. Place the image and the Asset Name in an <image> container, where this container is used to do some kinds of hover effect
4. Prepare the Grid and Sub-Grid arrangement for the Info
5. Create another hover layer with another image and a background-color
6. Set the opacity as 0
7. Create a CSS rule to update the Opacity to non-zero value while hovering over the <image> container

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
